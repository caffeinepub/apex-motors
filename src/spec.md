# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Render all global header text and icons in red across desktop and mobile without changing overall site theming or header behavior.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the header styling so the HOOD wordmark renders in red in the sticky desktop header.
- Ensure all desktop navigation link labels render in red.
- Update the “Book Test Drive” CTA label to render in red while remaining readable against its existing background.
- Update mobile header styling so the menu trigger (hamburger) icon renders in red.
- Update the mobile sheet menu so the HOOD wordmark and all nav link labels render in red.
- Preserve existing header navigation structure, scroll-to-section behavior, and mobile sheet open/close behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** All visible header typography and iconography appears in red on both desktop and mobile, with navigation and mobile menu behavior unchanged.

  "summary": "Header.tsx was updated to apply the `text-accent` class (presumably the red accent color) to the HOOD wordmark, desktop nav links, mobile menu trigger icon, and mobile sheet wordmark/nav links. However, the “Book Test Drive” CTA uses `bg-accent` and `text-accent` together, which likely makes the label unreadable against its background, and the mobile sheet’s built-in close icon (if present) is not explicitly styled red in the diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "The “Book Test Drive” CTA label renders in red (not black/white) and remains readable against its background.",
      "reason": "The CTA button sets both background and text to `accent` (`className=\"bg-accent text-accent ...\"`), which likely results in red text on a red background, failing the readability requirement.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "All visible header iconography renders in red (including within the mobile sheet menu).",
      "reason": "The diff explicitly colors the hamburger Menu icon red (`text-accent`) but does not show any styling for the mobile sheet close icon (commonly an X rendered by the Sheet component). Since UI components under `frontend/src/components/ui` cannot be edited, the header would need to pass styling/hooks to ensure the close icon is red; no such change is visible in the diff.",

      "description": "Added an unused import `X` from `lucide-react`.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks to make header typography/iconography red; `X` is imported but not used anywhere in the shown diff.",

  "summary": "The diff modifies HeroCarousel.tsx to use w-screen h-screen on the outer container and h-screen on each slide's inner div, along with -mt-20 to offset the sticky header. This addresses REQ-1's requirement to expand the carousel to full viewport width and height. Navigation arrows and dot indicators appear to be preserved via CarouselNext/CarouselPrevious components. The existing 3-slide content and auto-rotate behavior are preserved.",

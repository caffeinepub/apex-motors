  "summary": "All four requirements appear to be well-implemented in the diff. REQ-1 adds a Buy Now button to CarModelCard.tsx with a checkout modal. REQ-2 implements the three-step checkout flow (payment type, EMI plan, payment details) with a success screen. REQ-3 shows a ShowroomPanel alongside the checkout form in a side-by-side layout. REQ-4 creates frontend/src/content/showrooms.ts with a mapping of car IDs to showroom objects. No significant missing requirements or hallucinated features are detected.",

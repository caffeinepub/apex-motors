# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand the HeroCarousel component to fill the full viewport width and height (100vw × 100vh) so it covers the entire laptop screen without scrolling.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the HeroCarousel container to use 100vw × 100vh dimensions
- Ensure all slide wrappers and inner content containers stretch to fill the full viewport
- Preserve existing navigation arrows, dot indicators, auto-rotate behavior, and all three slides

**User-visible outcome:** The hero carousel fills the entire laptop screen on page load, with no scrollbars and all navigation controls remaining visible and accessible.
